My research interest lies in optimization in machine learning and its compilation, generative models, statistical inference (eg: statistical properties, causal inference). Currently, I have been developing my research on optimization of algorithms and deployment, specifically SGD and autoML complication since June 2022.

Additionally, I would be very happy to discuss with you the technical problems, especially when AI models land on real-world applications. If you are looking for any cooperation, feel free to reach me, at [qilong.pan@kaust.edu.sa](mailto:qilong.pan@kaust.edu.sa).
