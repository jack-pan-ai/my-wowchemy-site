abstract: Visually evaluating the goodness of generated Multivariate Time Series
  (MTS) are difficult to implement, especially in the case that the generative
  model is Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We present a general
  framework named Gaussian GANs to visually evaluate GANs using itself under the
  MTS generation task.  Firstly, we explicitly reconstruct the architecture of
  GANs by swapping its input and output. Secondly, we make the normality test of
  transformed MST where the Gaussian GANs serves as the transformation function.
  In order to simplify the normality test, an efficient visualization is
  proposed using the  distribution. On the UniMiB dataset, we provide empirical
  evidence showing that the normality test using Gaussian GANs
  and  visualization is effective and credible.
